# READ BEFORE CHANGING CODE

The `Master` and `Testing` branches should never be directly modified. Instead, create a new branch to commit your code to.

## Branches

* `Master` The master branch is stable, working code.
* `Testing` The testing branch is non-stable, but working code.
* Other branches are created to work on specific parts of the code. These branches are the only one that should be directly modified.

Branches should be named after what they are working on, e.g., the branch working on the drivetrain should be called `drivetrain`.

When your branch works, and you want to include your code into the final code, make a pull request to pull your code into `testing`. To make a pull request, go onto github, open the repository, and select pull request from along the top. You will need to select `testing` as the branch to pull into, and provide a short description of what you added, and what does and doesn't work.
